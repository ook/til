I used to setup postgresql native streaming replication. Since major 12 it's rather easy task and I was happy  with it.

I was searching a nice way to load balance PG queries when I hit PGPool2. I heard about it long time ago when it was only a pooling system: that's certainly why I missed its evolutions. Now it offers connection pooling (meh), replication (hmm), auto PG failover (w00t), load balancing (now we talk) and even HA from 3 instances of PGPool (gold!).
